BEGIN_PGML
  
    Cruise missiles built by an aerospace company are to be tested. The probability of a successful firing on any one test is [`p(S) = [$S]`].
    Assuming independent firings, what is the probability that the first failure occurs on the fifth firing? (Round to 4 decimal places).

        p(First Failure Occurring on Fifth Missile) = [___________]{$ans}
