### Suggestion: Text Editor for .pg Files

Download Visual Studio Code 
https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx

Add this code in the settings.json file

```json
    "files.associations": {
        "*.pg": "python"
    }
```

Python has a similar highlighting as PG files. I have not yet seen a PG text editor plugin anywhere.
